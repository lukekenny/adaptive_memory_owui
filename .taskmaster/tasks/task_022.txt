# Task ID: 22
# Title: Optimize Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 9, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct performance optimization across the entire plugin to improve response times and resource utilization.
# Details:
1. Implement caching mechanisms using Redis for frequently accessed data.
2. Optimize database queries using SQLAlchemy's query optimization techniques.
3. Implement database indexing for frequently queried fields.
4. Use asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations using asyncio.
5. Implement connection pooling for external services.
6. Optimize memory usage through efficient data structures and garbage collection.
7. Implement lazy loading for resource-intensive components.
8. Conduct performance profiling using cProfile and optimize bottlenecks.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct load testing using Locust.
2. Perform memory profiling using memory_profiler.
3. Benchmark key operations before and after optimization.
4. Conduct user perception testing for performance improvements.
