# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository and set up the development environment for the Adaptive Memory OpenWebUI Plugin.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository for the project.
2. Set up a virtual environment using Python 3.9+.
3. Install required dependencies:
   - OpenWebUI SDK (latest version)
   - Flask 2.3.x for API endpoints
   - SQLAlchemy 2.0.x for database operations
   - pytest 7.x for unit testing
4. Configure linting (flake8) and formatting (black) tools.
5. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
6. Create a project structure with directories for src, tests, docs, and config.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the repository is created and accessible.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed and working correctly.
3. Run linting and formatting checks.
4. Test the CI/CD pipeline with a sample commit.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Repository and Initialize Version Control [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Git repository for the project, initialize version control, and configure remote hosting (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
### Details:
Create a new repository using Git. Add a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files. Push the initial commit to the remote repository. Ensure branch protection rules are set for the main/production branch.

## 2. Set Up Python Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Establish a reproducible Python environment using tools like venv or conda.
### Details:
Create a virtual environment (e.g., python -m venv venv). Activate the environment and ensure Python version consistency. Document environment setup steps in the README.

## 3. Install and Manage Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create and maintain a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml file for dependency management.
### Details:
List all required libraries in requirements.txt or pyproject.toml. Use pip to install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt). Document installation instructions for contributors.

## 4. Configure Linting and Formatting Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up code quality tools such as linters (e.g., flake8, pylint) and formatters (e.g., black).
### Details:
Install linting and formatting tools as development dependencies. Add configuration files (e.g., .flake8, pyproject.toml for black). Integrate linting and formatting checks into the development workflow.

## 5. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Configure a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, linting, and deployment processes.
### Details:
Choose a CI/CD provider (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI). Create a pipeline configuration file (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml). Define steps for linting, testing, building, and deploying the project. Ensure the pipeline runs on every commit and pull request.

## 6. Establish Project Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Organize the project into logical directories for source code, tests, documentation, and configuration.
### Details:
Create directories such as src/ or project_name/, tests/, docs/, and configs/. Add __init__.py files where necessary. Ensure the structure is documented and follows best practices for Python projects.
