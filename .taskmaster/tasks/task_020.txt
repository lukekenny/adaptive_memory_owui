# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and implement a comprehensive testing strategy covering unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.
# Details:
1. Set up a testing framework using pytest.
2. Implement unit tests for all core components.
3. Create integration tests for end-to-end workflows.
4. Implement property-based testing using hypothesis.
5. Set up continuous integration using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
6. Implement code coverage reporting using coverage.py.
7. Create performance benchmarks using pytest-benchmark.
8. Implement user acceptance testing scripts.

# Test Strategy:
1. Aim for at least 90% code coverage.
2. Run the full test suite before each release.
3. Implement automated nightly tests for long-running scenarios.
4. Conduct regular code reviews focusing on test quality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Framework Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the core test automation framework, including architecture, tool selection, and environment configuration.
### Details:
Define requirements, select tools (e.g., Selenium, Pytest), design framework architecture, and set up initial project structure and environment automation.

## 2. Unit Test Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Develop and integrate unit tests for critical modules and functions.
### Details:
Write unit tests for core logic, focusing on high-risk and high-usage areas. Ensure tests are automated and included in the framework.

## 3. Integration Test Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Create integration tests to validate interactions between system components and external services.
### Details:
Develop tests that cover API interactions, database connections, and third-party integrations, including LLM and Google Gemini APIs.

## 4. LLM Connection Issue Resolution [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Investigate, reproduce, and resolve user-reported LLM connection issues, then validate with targeted tests.
### Details:
Analyze logs, simulate connection failures, improve error handling, and add integration tests to ensure robust LLM connectivity.

## 5. Google Gemini API Regression Fix [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Identify and address regressions in Google Gemini API integration, ensuring backward compatibility and reliability.
### Details:
Review recent changes, implement regression tests, and update integration logic as needed. Validate fixes with automated tests.

## 6. Installation Issue Remediation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Diagnose and resolve installation issues affecting user onboarding and adoption.
### Details:
Collect user feedback, reproduce installation failures, update installation scripts or documentation, and add automated installation tests.

## 7. Documentation Gap Closure [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Identify and fill critical documentation gaps, focusing on setup, troubleshooting, and usage guides.
### Details:
Audit existing documentation, prioritize missing or unclear sections, and update or create new docs to address user complaints.

## 8. Testing Framework Enhancement & Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5
### Description: Expand the testing framework to improve error handling and support property-based, coverage, performance, and UAT testing.
### Details:
Integrate property-based testing, coverage reporting, performance benchmarks, and UAT scripts. Enhance error handling in tests and application code.
