# Task ID: 11
# Title: Optimize Default Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Lower default similarity threshold and optimize out-of-box experience for better memory retrieval.
# Details:
1. Analyze current usage patterns to determine optimal default settings.
2. Implement A/B testing framework for configuration options.
3. Lower default similarity threshold from 0.7 to 0.5.
4. Implement adaptive threshold adjustment based on user interaction and feedback.
5. Create a configuration recommendation engine using machine learning (scikit-learn).
6. Implement automatic configuration tuning based on system performance and usage metrics.
7. Add a guided setup wizard for new users.
8. Create detailed analytics for configuration impact on memory retrieval and user satisfaction.

# Test Strategy:
1. A/B test different default configurations.
2. User acceptance testing for out-of-box experience.
3. Long-term performance analysis of adaptive configurations.
4. Usability testing of the setup wizard.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Resolve LLM Connection Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate, diagnose, and address persistent connection problems between the system and large language models (LLMs), ensuring stable and reliable integration.
### Details:
Collect logs and user reports, reproduce connection failures, identify root causes (e.g., network, authentication, API changes), implement fixes, and validate with regression tests.

## 2. Address Google Gemini API Regression [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and resolve regressions affecting the Google Gemini API integration, restoring expected functionality and preventing future disruptions.
### Details:
Review recent changes, analyze error logs, collaborate with Google API support if needed, implement code or configuration updates, and verify fixes with targeted tests.

## 3. Fix Installation Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Systematically address installation failures across supported environments to ensure a smooth onboarding experience for all users.
### Details:
Gather installation error reports, test installation on various platforms, update installation scripts and documentation, and automate installation verification.

## 4. Close Documentation Gaps [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and fill critical gaps in user and developer documentation, focusing on setup, troubleshooting, and advanced features.
### Details:
Audit existing documentation, prioritize missing or unclear sections based on user feedback, draft and review new content, and publish updates.

## 5. Enhance Error Handling Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve error detection, reporting, and recovery throughout the system to provide clear feedback and minimize user disruption.
### Details:
Map current error handling flows, implement standardized error messages, add logging and alerting, and ensure graceful recovery paths for common failures.

## 6. Develop Robust Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a comprehensive testing framework to ensure reliability, catch regressions, and validate critical workflows.
### Details:
Define test coverage requirements, select or build testing tools, create automated test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end), and integrate with CI/CD pipelines.

## 7. Integrate Analytics and Usage Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6
### Description: Implement analytics and monitoring tools to track system usage, performance, and user behavior, enabling data-driven improvements.
### Details:
Select analytics platforms, instrument key workflows, define metrics (e.g., latency, error rates, feature adoption), and build dashboards for ongoing monitoring.

## 8. Implement Adaptive Tuning and Auto-Tuning Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop adaptive tuning mechanisms and auto-tuning capabilities to optimize system performance and user experience based on real-time analytics.
### Details:
Leverage analytics data to adjust thresholds, recommend configurations, and automatically tune system parameters; validate improvements with A/B testing.
